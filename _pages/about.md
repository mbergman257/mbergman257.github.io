Hi! I'm researching AI, Computer Vision, and Robotics in the marine domain at Purdue University. My Master's thesis investigated wildlife object detection and hierarchical classification by implementing and developing state of the art computer vision methods. A core part of my research investigates training models using imperfect or otherwise challenging datasets - commonly seen with wildlife image datasets.

I also spent time reworking our lab's graduate-level mobile robotics (ROS2) course, Autonomous Systems. Aside from this, my graduate coursework at Purdue included Deep Learning/AI, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision in Embedded Systems, Optimization, and Adv. Controls.

Please feel free to connect on LinkedIn and explore the rest of my portfolio!
